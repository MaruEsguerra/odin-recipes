        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>283g onion</li>
            <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp neutral oil</li>
            <li>155g potato</li>
            <li>115g carrot</li>
            <li>40g cremini mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp grated ginger, with juice</li>
            <li>1/2 garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>285g beef</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red wine</li>
            <li>1 beef broth cube, dissolved in 2 cups of water</li>
            <li>1/4 tbsp filipino curry powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
            <li>1/2 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1/2 package of Japanese curry roux</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the onion into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large heavy-bottomed pot on medium heat. When hot, add some of the unsalted butter, half of the neutral oil, and add the onions. Stir to coat the onions.</li>
            <li>Saute the onions, stirring once in a while, for about 20-25 minutes. Move on to the next step but keep an eye on the onions. Once wilted, reduce the stove heat to medium low to prevent the onions from burning. Once the onions are tender, translucent, and a bit caramelized, remove the pot from the heat and set aside until the beef is done searing.</li>
            <li>Peel and cut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Soak in water for 15 minutes to remove the starch, then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Peel and cut the carrot into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Clean the mushrooms and cut into thin slices. Tip: mushrooms absorb moisture so it's better to avoid washing them. Brush them off, but it's okay to quickly rinse them.</li>
            <li>Grate the ginger and set aside. Mince the garlic.</li>
            <li>Cut your beef into cubes and lightly sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Then, lightly coat the meat with all purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Sear the beef.
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat a pan on medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the remainin oil and butter. Cook the beef in 2 batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
                    <li>Sear the beef cubes on one side until brown and crusty, then turn them over to cook all sides. The beef will release itself from the pan when the surface is seared nicely. Transfer the seared meat to a plate and work on the next batch.</li>
                    <li>Once all the meat is seared, deglaze the pan. Add the red wine and use a wooden blunt-end spatula to release the flavorful fond that are stuck to the bottom of the pan. Turn off the heat and set aside the deglazed pan liquid temporarily.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Cook the curry.
                <ol>
                    <li>Reheat the pot with the onions on the stove over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger.</li>
                    <li>Add the curry powder and tomato paste and sauce for 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the seared beef, any juices from the plate, and the deglazed pan liquid into the pot and mix them all together. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, letting the alcohol from the wine evaporate.</li>
                    <li>Add the carrots and mushrooms and mix them all together. Add the beef broth to just cover the ingredients. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and bring to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Once boiling, skim off the scum and fat from the broth.</li>
                    <li>Add the honey, worcestershire sauce, and milk to the broth.</li>
                    <li>Add the bay leaf and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Simmer on low heat until the meat is tender, which takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes. If there is evaporation, you may need to add more broth or water, but only enough to cover the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>When the beef is tender, add the potatoes, close the lid, and simmer for 15 minutes until the potatoes are cooked through.</li>
                    <li>When the potatoes are tender, turn off the heat and discard the bay leaf.</li>
                    <li>Now, add the Japanese curry roux. After adding it in, simmer on the lowest heat, stirring often for 3-5 minutes until the sauce thickens. Be careful not to burn the curry sauce! If it's too thick, add water to dilute. If it's too soupy, uncover the pot and simmer a bit longer.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Serve the curry on individual plates along with rice.</li>
        </ol>
