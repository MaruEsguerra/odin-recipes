                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>400g good-quality dark chocolate, about 70% cacao</li>
                        <li>200 ml heavy whipping cream</li>
                        <li>1 tbsp brandy</li>
                        <li>Dutch-process cocoa powder, to coat</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>With a sharp knife, chop the chocolate into smaller pieces so that they will melt faster and more evenly.</li>
                        <li>Line an 8 x 8 inch baking dish with parchment paper. It's important to choose a tray that's the right size, because if you use a tray that's too big, the chocolate will be flatter.</li>
                        <li>Add the heavy whipping cream into a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat the cream to <em>almost</em> a boil. Whisk lightly to evenly distribute the heat. Keep an eye on the cream to make sure it doesn't boil. Overheating the cream may cause the chocolate to separate in the next step.</li>
                        <li>When you see small bubbles form around the edges of the saucepan, remove it from the heat.</li>
                        <li>Next, add the chocolate pieces into the cream and stir with a silicone spatula to combine. Make sure your utensil is dry. Introducing even a tiny bit of water or steam may cause the chocolate to seize.</li>
                        <li>Mix until the chocolate is melted and there are no more lumps. The chocolate and cream mixture should be completely smooth.</li>
                        <li>Add the brandy and stir to incorporate.</li>
                        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth the surface with the silicone spatula.</li>
                        <li>Tap the disk onto the counter a few times to make sure the chocolate is evenly distributed. Refrigerate until firm, which takes about 4-5 hours.</li>
                        <li>After chilling, remove the chocolate with its parchment paper from the baking dish. Peel away the parchment paper from the sides.</li>
                        <li>With a sharp knife, cut off the stray pieces of excess chocolate around the four sides to make sharp corners and edges.</li>
                        <li>Warm up the knife with a hot towel, then cut the chocolate slab into 1 inch strips. Make sure to clean and warm the knife before each cut to achieve a nice sharp cut.</li>
                        <li>If your baking dish has curved edges and corners, the edge strips may not be the ideal shape for cutting into neat cubes. If that's the case, cut those off and save those pieces for yourself to enjoy.</li>
                        <li>Cut the strips into cubes. Remember to clean and warm up the knife before each cut.</li>
                        <li>Using a sugar duster or fine-mesh sieve, sprinkle the cubes with the dutch-process cocoa powder.</li>
                        <li>Keep the Nama chocolate refrigerated. Serve on a plate or put it in a box as a gift.</li>
                        <li>To store, keep it in an airtight container and place in the fridge for up to 4 days or for up to a month in the freezer.</li>
